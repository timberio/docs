# Elixir

Timber integrates with [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) through the [`:timber` Hex package](https://hex.pm/packages/timber), enabling you to send Elixir logs to your Timber account.

## Features

* \*\*\*\*[**Simple Integration.** Installs as an Elixir `logger` backend](./#installation).
* \*\*\*\*[**Fast & light-weight.**  Designed with performance in mind.](./#performance)
* **Support for** [**local**](./#local-context-default) **and** [**global**](./#global-context) **context.**
* \*\*\*\*[**Automatic context capturing.**](./#automatic-context)\*\*\*\*
* \*\*\*\*[**Strong structured logging support.**](./#structured-logging)\*\*\*\*
* \*\*\*\*[**Integrates with popular 3rd party libraries such as `Phoenix` and `Plug`.**](./#integrations)\*\*\*\*

## Example

To quickly demonstrate the power of Timber, the following example logs a simple structured log with context:

```elixir
Timber.add_context(user: %{id: "d23f6h7ffx"})

Logger.info(
    "Order #1234 placed, total: $520.23",
    event: %{order_placed: %{id: 1234, total: 520.23}}
)
```

This produces the following JSON log line:

```javascript
{
    "dt": "2019-03-04T03:44:21.221232Z",
    "level": "info",
    "message": "Order #1234 placed, total: $520.23",
    "order_placed": {
        "id": 1234,
        "total": 520.23
    },
    "context": {
        "runtime": {
            "vm_pid": "<0.9960.261>",
            "module_name": "MyModule",
            "line": 371,
            "function": "my_func/2",
            "file": "lib/my_app/my_module.ex",
            "application": "my_app"
        },
        "system": {
            "hostname": "ec2-44-125-241-8",
            "pid": 20643
        },
        "user": {
            "id": "d23f6h7ffx"
        }
    }
}
```

## Installation

{% hint style="info" %}
If you're unsure, we recommend installing via the "HTTP" method. To understand why you would choose one over the other, please see the ["Sending Logs To Timber" guide](../../../guides/sending-logs-to-timber.md).
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="HTTP" %}
Send logs directly to Timber from within your app over HTTP:

1. In `mix.exs`, add the `:timber` dependency:  


   {% code-tabs %}
   {% code-tabs-item title="mix.exs" %}
   ```elixir
   defp deps do
     [
       {:timber, "~> 3.0"}
     ]
   end
   ```
   {% endcode-tabs-item %}
   {% endcode-tabs %}

2. In `config/prod.exs`, install the Timber logger backend, _**replace `YOUR_API_KEY` and `YOUR_SOURCE_ID` accordingly**_:  


   {% code-tabs %}
   {% code-tabs-item title="config/prod.exs" %}
   ```elixir
   config :logger,
     backends: [Timber.LoggerBackends.HTTP]

   config :timber,
     api_key: "YOUR_API_KEY",
     source_id: "YOUR_SOURCE_ID"
   ```
   {% endcode-tabs-item %}
   {% endcode-tabs %}

3. _Optionally_ install [integrations](integrations/) for [Plug](integrations/plug.md), [Phoenix](integrations/phoenix/), [Ecto](integrations/ecto.md), and [more](integrations/)!
4. _Optionally_ test the pipes to verify installation:  


   ```bash
   MIX_ENV=prod mix timber.test_the_pipes
   ```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="STDOUT" %}
Write logs to `STDOUT` and ship them to Timber external from your app:

{% hint style="warning" %}
This method is more advanced and requires a separate step to ship logs to Timber. Basic knowledge of `STDOUT` and log management is required. If you are unsure, please use the "HTTP" method. For more information on the advantages of this method please see [this guide](../../../guides/sending-logs-to-timber.md).
{% endhint %}

1. In your `mix.exs` file add the `:timber` dependency:  


   {% code-tabs %}
   {% code-tabs-item title="mix.exs" %}
   ```elixir
   defp deps do
     [
       {:timber, "~> 3.0"}
     ]
   end
   ```
   {% endcode-tabs-item %}
   {% endcode-tabs %}

2. In your `config.exs` file install the Timber console JSON formatter:  


   {% code-tabs %}
   {% code-tabs-item title="config/config.exs" %}
   ```elixir
   config :logger,
     backends: [:console],
     utc_log: true
  
   config :logger, :console,
     format: {Timber.Formatter, :format},
     metadata: :all

   ```
   {% endcode-tabs-item %}
   {% endcode-tabs %}

3. _Optionally_ install [integrations](integrations/) for [Plug](integrations/plug.md), [Phoenix](integrations/phoenix/), [Ecto](integrations/ecto.md), and [more](integrations/)!
4. At this point your application is writing logs to `STDOUT` in JSON format. Please choose the appropriate [platform](../../platforms/), [log forwarder](../../log-forwarders/), or [operating system](../../operating-systems/).
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Configuration

### Timber Configuration

All configuration options for `:timber` can be found in the [`Timber.Config` documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/timber/Timber.Config.html#content).

### Elixir Logger Configuration

All configuration options for the Elixir `Logger` can be found in the [`Logger` documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/logger/Logger.html#module-configuration).

## Usage

### Basic Logging

Timber works with your existing [`Logger`](https://hexdocs.pm/logger/Logger.html) calls, no changes necessary:

```elixir
Logger.info("Hello world")
```

### Structured Logging

{% hint style="info" %}
If you haven't already, please see our [structured logging best practices guide](../../../guides/structured-logging-best-practices.md).
{% endhint %}

Your `Logger` calls now take an `:event` metadata key where you can pass structured data. We recommend logging data with a root level namespace as shown below to avoid type conflicts with other events. You can read more on this in our [Event Naming guide.](../../../guides/structured-logging-best-practices.md)

```elixir
Logger.info(fn ->
    event = %{order_placed: %{order_id: "aarg23dw", total: 100.23}}
    message = "Order aarg23dw placed, total: $100.23"
    {message, event: event}
end)
```

### Adding Context

{% hint style="info" %}
Before capturing context, please make sure Timber does not already capture the context you want \([see the Automatic Context section](./#context)\).
{% endhint %}

#### Local Context \(default\)

Because Elixir is a highly concurrent language, Timber context, by default, is local to the Elixir process. This makes context management easy since it dies with the process. This fits well with Erlang / Elixir concurrency patterns since processes are typically ephemeral. Adding context in this fashion is simple:

```elixir
Timber.add_context(user: %{id: "d23f6h7ffx", email: "paul@bunyan.com"})
```

If you are spawning processes and wish to copy context to that process see the ["Copying Context To Other Processes" section](./#copying-context-to-other-processes).

#### Global Context

In rare cases you'll want to set global context. Global context applies to _all_ processes and should be used with care. Setting global context follows the same pattern as local context except it must be explicitly specified as the second argument:

```elixir
Timber.add_context(user: %{id: "d23f6h7ffx", email: "paul@bunyan.com"}, :global)
```

### Deleting Context

{% hint style="warning" %}
As stated above, you should not have to remove context except in rare cases. Context should die with the local process.
{% endhint %}

Given the above `:user` context, context can be deleted by passing the key:

#### Local Context \(default\)

```elixir
Timber.delete_context(:user)
```

#### Global Context

```elixir
Timber.delete_context(:user, :global)
```

## Guides

### Tying Logs To Users

A very common use-case for context is tying logs to users, you can accomplish this by setting user context immediately after you log the user in. This is typically done in an authentication [plug](https://hexdocs.pm/plug/readme.html):

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="auth\_plug.ex" %}
```elixir
defmodule AuthPlug
    @behaviour Plug
    
    def call(conn, _default, opts \\ []) do
        # ...
        Timber.add_context(user: %{id: "abcd1234"})
        # ...
    end
end
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

Be careful not to include personally identifiable information for privacy reasons.

### Tying Logs To HTTP Requests

{% hint style="info" %}
Timber offers a [`Plug` and `Phoenix` integration]() that does this automatically.
{% endhint %}

Another common use-case for context is tying logs to HTTP requests through the request ID. You can see an example of this in the [`:timber_plug` 's `HTTPContext` module](https://github.com/timberio/timber-elixir-plug/blob/master/lib/timber_plug/http_context.ex).

### Timing Code Execution

Timber offers utilities for timing code execution and including those timings in your logs. Timing in Erlang should not be done using wall clock time, instead, it should use monotonic time:

```elixir
timer = Timber.start_timer()

# ... issue the HTTP request ...

duration_ms = Timber.duration_ms(timer)

Logger.info(
  event = %{http_response_received: %{method: "GET", host: "api.payments.com", path: "/payment", duration_ms: duration_ms}}
  message = "Received POST https://api.payments.com/payment in 56.7ms",
  {message, event: event}
)
```

### Copying Context To Child Processes

As described in the ["Setting Context" section](./#setting-context), Timber's context is local to each process. This ensures that each process can maintain context specific to it's state without conflicting with other processes, but there are times where you'll want to carry context over to child processes, such as when using the [`Task` module](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Task.html):

```elixir
current_context = Timber.LocalContext.load()

Task.async fn ->
  Timber.LocalContext.save(current_context)
  Logger.info("Logs from a separate process")
end
```

The new process spawned with `Task.async/1` will now contain the same Timber context as its parent. Please note, that the [runtime context's](./#runtime) `vm_pid` will be overridden and remain true to the local process.

### Log to an additional IO Device

Writing to an additional IO device is as simple as installing a `Logger` backend for your desired device.

#### Logging to STDOUT

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have the means to log to `STDOUT,` we highly recommend that you redirect STDOUT to Timber through one of our [platform](../../platforms/), [log forwarder](../../log-forwarders/), or [operating system](../../operating-systems/) integrations instead of shipping logs from within your app. You can read more about that [here](../../../guides/sending-logs-to-timber.md). 
{% endhint %}

Logging to `:stdout` uses the Elixir provided [`:console` backend](https://hexdocs.pm/logger/Logger.html#module-console-backend). You can read more about configuring the `:console`backend [here](https://hexdocs.pm/logger/Logger.html#module-console-backend). Simply add it as a `Logger` backend:

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="config/config.exs" %}
```elixir
config :logger, backends: [Timber.LoggerBackends.HTTP, :console]
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

From here you can redirect `STDOUT` to a [file](../../log-forwarders/fluent-bit.md), [Syslog](../../log-forwarders/syslog.md), or any device of your choice.

#### Logging to a File

{% hint style="warning" %}
We highly recommend that you log to `STDOUT` and redirect the output to a file when starting your Elixir application. As this follows the 12 Factor methodolgy.
{% endhint %}

If you cannot redirect `STDOUT` to a file you can install the [`logger_file_backend` library](https://github.com/onkel-dirtus/logger_file_backend). Information on installing that can be found [here](https://github.com/onkel-dirtus/logger_file_backend#configuration).

### Dynamically Adding Timber

You can dynamically add the Timber HTTP backend at runtime via your `Application.start/2` function:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Application do
  use Application

  def start(_type, _args) do
    # Dynamically add the Timber backend
    Logger.add_backend(Timber.LoggerBackends.HTTP)
    
    children = []
    opts = [strategy: :one_for_one, name: Odin.Util.Supervisor]
    Supervisor.start_link(children, opts)
  end
end
```

A common use case is to only add the backend if the `TIMBER_API_KEY` environment variable is present. Because you're adding the backend at runtime you can specify any conditions you like.

## Automatic Context

`:timber` automatically captures [context](../../../under-the-hood/concepts.md#context) to enrich your logs.

### system 

The `system` context captures system level information such as hostname and pid:

```javascript
{
    "context": {
        "system": {
            "hostname": "ec2-44-125-241-8",
            "pid": 20643
        }
    }
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `context.system.hostname` | `string` | System level hostname, value of [`:inet.gethostname()`](http://erlang.org/doc/man/inet.html#gethostname-0)\`\` |
| `context.system.pid` | `int` | System level process ID, value of [`System.get_pid()`](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/System.html#get_pid/0)\`\` |

### runtime

The `runtime` context captures information about the originator of the log line. By default, the Elixir `Logger` includes [runtime metadata](https://hexdocs.pm/logger/Logger.html#module-metadata) that Timber simply takes advantage of.

```javascript
{
    "context": {
        "runtime": {
            "vm_pid": "<0.9960.261>",
            "module_name": "MyModule",
            "line": 371,
            "function": "my_func/2",
            "file": "lib/my_app/my_module.ex",
            "application": "my_app"
        }
    }
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `context.runtime.vm_pid` | `string` | The Elixir VM pid \(not the operating system level pid\) |
| `context.runtime.module_name` | `string` | The name of the module where the log statement originated. |
| `context.runtime.line` | `int` | The line number where the log statement originated. |
| `context.runtime.file` | \`string | The file where the log statement originated. |
| `context.runtime.function` |  | The function where the log statement originated. |
| `content.runtime.application` |  | The Elixir component app where the log statement originated. |

## Integrations

Timber integrates with 3rd party libraries a la carte style, allowing you to pick and choose the integrations you want. Integrations with timber are entirely optional and serve to upgrade your logs with rich context and metadata if you choose to use them:

{% page-ref page="integrations/" %}

## Performance

Extreme care was taken into the design of `:timber` to be fast and reliable:

1. `:timber` works directly with the [Elixir `Logger`](https://hexdocs.pm/logger/master/Logger.html), automatically assuming all of the [stability and performance benefits](https://hexdocs.pm/logger/master/Logger.html#module-runtime-configuration) this provides, such as back pressure, load shedding, and defensability around `Logger` failures.
2. Log data is buffered and flushed on an interval to optimize performance and delivery.
3. The `:timber` HTTP backend uses a controlled [multi-buffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_buffering) design to efficiently ship data to the Timber service.
4. Connections are re-used and rotated to ensure efficient delivery of log data.
5. Delivery failures are retried with an exponential backoff, maximizing successful delivery.
6. [Msgpack](https://msgpack.org/index.html) is used for payload encoding for it's superior performance and memory management.
7. The Timber service ingest endpoint is a HA servce designed to handle extreme fluctuations of volume, it responds in under 50ms to reduce back pressure.

## FAQs

### Will installing Timber affect my application's performance?

No. Timber was designed with a [keen focus on performance](./#performance). It leans heavily on Elixir's `Logger` delegating asynchronous log processing to the `Logger` processes. Timber is also battle tested on hundreds of Elixir apps. For example, we use Timber internally at Timber in the most performance sensitive areas of our log ingestion pipeline without any issue.

### Can Timber crash my app?

No, Timber is installed as an [Elixir `Logger` backend](https://hexdocs.pm/logger/Logger.html#module-backends), which are protected from failures, back pressure, and the like. You can read more about the Elixir / Erlang logger and it's design in the [docs](https://hexdocs.pm/logger/Logger.html).

## Troubleshooting

### Test The Pipes

{% hint style="warning" %}
This should be run on the actual host in question. This ensures that your API key is set properly and your remote host can communicate with Timber.
{% endhint %}

The `:timber` hex package comes with a `test-the-pipes` mix command:

```text
mix timber.test_the_pipes
```

This will attempt to send test log messages to your account and display any errors along the way. This is the simplest way to verify that Timber is installed correctly.

### Enable Debug Logging

If the above command does not shed light on the problem, then we recommend enabling debug logging within the `:timber` library itself by adding this to your `config/config.ex` file:

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="config/config.exs" %}
```elixir
config :timber,
  debug_io_device: :stdio
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

Because the `:timber` library operates within the `Logger` itself it cannot call `Log.*` statements. The above configuration routes all `:timber` debug statements to `STDOUT` , allowing you access generic output statements generated by the `:timber` library. Once you've done this you'll want to analyze these statements, looking specifically for statements on the `error` level. This should give you insight into the functioning of the `:timber` library and any problems it's experiencing.

### More

If all else fails, Timber offers more generic troubleshooting methods, like testing delivery via a `curl` command. Please see our [log delivery troubleshooting guide](../../../guides/troubleshooting-log-delivery.md):
